# Delayed Academia

Welcome, gentlepersons.

This would be my first attempt at giving something moderately useful back to the community I've taken so much from.
Please be kind.

### Code Contributions
1. Functional sets in Python (purely functional -- no mutable data involved)
   * Adapted *cough* ripped off *cough* from my coding assignments that were a part of Martin
     Odersky's excellent offering on Coursera: "Functional Programming Principals in Scala"
   * It blew my mind when I saw that sets could be represented purely as functions; even more
     so when I inadverently ended up learning about closures in an attempt to solve the coding
     assignments
   * This should give intermediate programmers an idea about how to implement this concept in
     Python, and by extension, any language that offers functions first-class citizenship
